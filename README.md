# GPX-Scraper
Library to scrape info from site GPX-Plus

This uses Selenium with the Chrome driver, so the Chrome driver is required. You can find it here http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

It can currently scrape a users profile info, and pokemon info. There will be no automation done with this.

Not done yet, but soon will be.
